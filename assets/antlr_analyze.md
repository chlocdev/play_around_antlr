To identify which rules in the ANTLR parser might be recursive or anomalous, you can analyze the profiling table based on several factors:

1. **High Invocation Counts with High Total Processing Time:**
   - Rules that are invoked many times and have a high total processing time could indicate recursion. Recursive rules tend to call themselves repeatedly, leading to higher invocation counts and longer total processing times.

2. **High Average Processing Time:**
   - If a rule has a high average processing time compared to others, it might be doing more work per invocation, which could indicate recursion or complexity.

3. **RecognitionException and NoViableAltException Counts:**
   - High counts of `RecognitionException` and `NoViableAltException` can indicate that a rule is problematic or complex. Recursion can sometimes lead to these exceptions if the rule cannot find a valid path through the input.

4. **Disparity Between Min and Max Processing Times:**
   - A significant difference between the minimum and maximum processing times for a rule might suggest that the rule's processing time varies widely, possibly due to recursive calls or varying input complexities.

### Example Analysis Steps

1. **Sort by Invocation Counts and Total Processing Time:**
   - Identify rules with the highest invocation counts and total processing times.
   
   ```python
   df.sort_values(by=['invocations', 'time (ms) total'], ascending=False)
   ```

2. **Check for High Average Processing Time:**
   - Look for rules with high average processing times.
   
   ```python
   df[df['time (ms) avg'] > threshold]  # Define a threshold based on the overall average
   ```

3. **Identify High Exception Counts:**
   - Identify rules with significant counts of `RecognitionException` and `NoViableAltException`.
   
   ```python
   df[df['RecognitionException counts'] > 0]
   df[df['NoViableAltException counts'] > 0]
   ```

4. **Examine Disparity Between Min and Max Processing Times:**
   - Calculate the difference between min and max processing times and sort.
   
   ```python
   df['time_diff'] = df['time (ms) max'] - df['time (ms) min']
   df.sort_values(by='time_diff', ascending=False)
   ```

### Example Code

Here's how you might implement this analysis in Python using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example profiling table as a DataFrame
data = {
    'rule name': ['rule1', 'rule2', 'rule3', 'rule4'],
    'invocations': [1000, 500, 2000, 1500],
    'time (ms) min': [1, 2, 1, 2],
    'time (ms) max': [100, 50, 200, 150],
    'time (ms) total': [50000, 20000, 100000, 80000],
    'time (ms) avg': [50, 40, 50, 53.33],
    'RecognitionException counts': [0, 5, 0, 10],
    'NoViableAltException counts': [2, 0, 1, 3]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Sort by invocations and total processing time
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['invocations', 'time (ms) total'], ascending=False)
print("Sorted by invocations and total processing time:")
print(sorted_df)

# Filter by high average processing time (example threshold)
high_avg_df = df[df['time (ms) avg'] > 50]
print("\nRules with high average processing time:")
print(high_avg_df)

# Filter by high exception counts
high_recognition_exception_df = df[df['RecognitionException counts'] > 0]
high_no_viable_alt_exception_df = df[df['NoViableAltException counts'] > 0]
print("\nRules with RecognitionException counts:")
print(high_recognition_exception_df)
print("\nRules with NoViableAltException counts:")
print(high_no_viable_alt_exception_df)

# Calculate the disparity between min and max processing times and sort
df['time_diff'] = df['time (ms) max'] - df['time (ms) min']
disparity_df = df.sort_values(by='time_diff', ascending=False)
print("\nRules with high disparity between min and max processing times:")
print(disparity_df)
```

By following these steps and using this code, you can identify potentially recursive or anomalous rules in your ANTLR parser based on the profiling table.
