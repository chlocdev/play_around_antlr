ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator used for reading, processing, and executing or translating structured text or binary files. It provides various metrics to help developers understand the performance and efficiency of their grammars. Here's an explanation of each metric and its unit:

1. **Invocations**:
   - **Definition**: The number of times a particular rule in the grammar is invoked during parsing.
   - **Unit**: Count (number of invocations).

2. **Time (ms)**:
   - **Definition**: The total time spent in a particular rule during parsing, measured in milliseconds.
   - **Unit**: Milliseconds (ms).

3. **Total k**:
   - **Definition**: The total amount of lookahead tokens consumed for a rule. Lookahead tokens are used to decide which path to take in the grammar.
   - **Unit**: Count (number of tokens).

4. **Max k**:
   - **Definition**: The maximum amount of lookahead tokens used in a single decision for a rule.
   - **Unit**: Count (number of tokens).

5. **Ambiguities**:
   - **Definition**: The number of ambiguities detected in the grammar. An ambiguity occurs when a particular input can be parsed in more than one way.
   - **Unit**: Count (number of ambiguities).

6. **DFA Cache Miss**:
   - **Definition**: The number of times the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) cache is missed. The DFA is used to speed up the parsing by caching decisions, and a miss indicates that the DFA had to be recomputed.
   - **Unit**: Count (number of cache misses).

These metrics provide insights into how the parser is performing and where there might be inefficiencies or potential improvements in the grammar design.
