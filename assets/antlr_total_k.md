To measure the total amount of lookahead tokens consumed for a rule in an ANTLR parser, you'll need to customize the ANTLR runtime in Python. ANTLR uses lookahead tokens to decide which path to take in the grammar during parsing, and understanding this can be crucial for analyzing and optimizing grammar performance.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to customize ANTLR for measuring the total lookahead tokens consumed:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have ANTLR installed and set up for Python. You’ll need the ANTLR Python runtime and your ANTLR grammar files.

```bash
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

### 2. Customize the ANTLR Runtime

You need to modify the ANTLR runtime to keep track of the number of lookahead tokens consumed. This involves subclassing the `Parser` and `Lexer` classes.

#### Subclass the Parser

1. **Create a Custom Parser Class**

   Subclass the `Parser` class to keep track of lookahead tokens.

   ```python
   from antlr4.Parser import Parser
   from antlr4.ParserATNSimulator import ParserATNSimulator
   from antlr4.TokenStreamRewriter import TokenStreamRewriter

   class CustomParser(Parser):
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.lookahead_tokens_consumed = 0

       def consume(self):
           token = super().consume()
           self.lookahead_tokens_consumed += 1
           return token

       def get_lookahead_tokens_consumed(self):
           return self.lookahead_tokens_consumed

   # Optionally, you can subclass ParserATNSimulator if needed for more specific tracking
   class CustomParserATNSimulator(ParserATNSimulator):
       def __init__(self, parser, atn, decisionToDFA, sharedContextCache):
           super().__init__(parser, atn, decisionToDFA, sharedContextCache)
           self.lookahead_tokens_consumed = 0

       def consume(self, tokenIndex):
           self.lookahead_tokens_consumed += 1
           return super().consume(tokenIndex)

       def get_lookahead_tokens_consumed(self):
           return self.lookahead_tokens_consumed
   ```

2. **Modify the Grammar File**

   Generate the parser and lexer from your grammar file using the ANTLR tool.

   ```bash
   antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 YourGrammar.g4
   ```

#### Subclass the Lexer (Optional)

If you also want to track tokens consumed by the lexer, you can subclass the `Lexer` class similarly.

1. **Create a Custom Lexer Class**

   ```python
   from antlr4.Lexer import Lexer

   class CustomLexer(Lexer):
       def __init__(self, input=None, output=None):
           super().__init__(input, output)
           self.tokens_consumed = 0

       def nextToken(self):
           token = super().nextToken()
           if token.type != Token.EOF:
               self.tokens_consumed += 1
           return token

       def get_tokens_consumed(self):
           return self.tokens_consumed
   ```

2. **Update Your Parsing Code**

   Use your custom parser and lexer classes in your code.

   ```python
   from antlr4 import InputStream
   from YourGrammarLexer import CustomLexer  # Import your custom lexer
   from YourGrammarParser import CustomParser  # Import your custom parser

   def main():
       lexer = CustomLexer(InputStream("your input text"))
       stream = CommonTokenStream(lexer)
       parser = CustomParser(stream)

       tree = parser.yourRule()  # Parse with your rule

       print(f"Lookahead tokens consumed: {parser.get_lookahead_tokens_consumed()}")
       # If using CustomLexer
       print(f"Tokens consumed by lexer: {lexer.get_tokens_consumed()}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

### 3. Test and Verify

Run your parser with the custom lexer and parser and check the output for the number of lookahead tokens consumed. This will help you understand how many tokens are being used by each rule and optimize as needed.

### Additional Notes

- **ANTLR Version**: Make sure to check compatibility with your version of ANTLR. The code might need adjustments if the API changes.
- **Complexity**: Customizing the runtime can be complex and requires a good understanding of ANTLR internals. Thoroughly test your modifications.
- **Documentation and Community**: For more information or support, refer to the [ANTLR documentation](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) and community forums.

By following these steps, you can measure the total amount of lookahead tokens consumed for each rule, giving you insights into how your grammar is being parsed and how efficiently tokens are being used.
